## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main file containing all the HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript functionality.

## Customization

You can easily customize the content and styling:

- **Content**: All the text is located directly in the `index.html` file within the `<body>` tag. You can edit the headings, paragraphs, and timeline events to fit your needs.
- **Styling**: The CSS is located within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` of the `index.html` file. You can change colors, fonts, and layout by modifying the CSS variables and rules.
    - **Colors**: Theming is controlled by CSS variables at the top of the style block. You can change the `--bg-color`, `--text-color`, `--link-color`, etc., for both light and dark modes.
    - **Fonts**: The page uses the 'Inter' font from Google Fonts. You can change this by updating the `<link>` in the `<head>` and modifying the `font-family` property in the `body` style.
